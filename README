StrusPattern provides efficient pattern matching on text. It uses the Intel hyperscan library for matching regular expressions.
With strusPattern you define patterns on 2 levels, the first levels defines lexems by regular expressions and the second level
allows you to define patterns in a regular language with the lexems created in the first step as alphabet.
